Customer satisfaction prediction on Olist Brazillian Dataset-Tackling a **classification problem**
**Business problem** :
The Olist store is an e-commerce business headquartered in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This firm acts as a single point of contact between various small businesses and the customers who wish to buy their products. Recently, they uploaded a dataset on Kaggle that contains information about 100k orders made at multiple marketplaces between 2016 to 2018. What we purchase on e-commerce websites is affected by the reviews which we read about the product posted on that website. This firm can certainly leverage these reviews to remove those products which consistently receive negative reviews. It could also advertise those items which are popular amongst the customers.
